# Resume

An accomplished developer and project lead, with experience working in self-directed and team settings. Capable of balancing project goals and resources to set reasonable expectations for software production, and follow through with on-time delivery. Creative, driven and organized.

Believes strongly that as a programmer, and a maker of things, one should: be able to reason about their design and implementation, put team productivity over individual preference, focus on proven concepts and methods rather than particular skills or languages, and have a highly developed notion of the trade-offs and consequences involved in the decision-making process.

Lived and worked in Chile from 2013 to 2017, during this time he: participated in Startup Chile, a globally recognised start-up accelerator, took the lead on a software project for Chile's largest tourism company, formed part of the initial engineering team at Postedin, a Chilean start-up that has grown exponentially over the past 3 years, and learnt to speak Spanish fluently.

Strongly prefers a functional programming style, with language and tooling decisions guided by the needs of individual projects and teams.
