# Resume

An accomplished developer and project lead, with experience working in self-directed and team settings. Capable of balancing project goals and resources to set reasonable expectations for software production, and follow through with on-time delivery.

Believes strongly that as a software creator one should: be able to reason about their design and implementation, focus on proven concepts and methods rather than particular tools or languages, and have a highly developed notion of the trade-offs and consequences involved in the decision-making process.

Lived and worked in Chile from 2013 to 2017, during this time he: participated in Startup Chile, a globally recognised start-up accelerator, took the lead on a software project for Chile's largest tourism company and formed part of the initial engineering team at Postedin, a Chilean start-up that has seen exponential growth since its founding.

Is enthusiastic about functional programming and always looking to expand his understanding of category theory, declarative design and data orientation.
