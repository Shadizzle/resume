## Cover Letter

To COMPANY,

I am an experienced, autodidactic software developer and a people-focused team lead. As a programmer, I have grown over the last two years from an object-oriented programming style into a functional style, with a strong understanding of the mathematical basis corresponding to many of the techniques involved as well as how to translate that knowledge into agile, safe software.

As the technical co-founder of Medesen I made all of the company's technical decisions, including those related to hiring and accounting. I architected both the original prototype and its eventual redesign, I was responsible for directing contractors with a high degree of technical detail and balancing the project's financial and business needs with it's design goals to provide high quality software on time.

As the lead developer of the Customer Relationship Management application at Cocha Tourism, I connected teams across departments, paying enormous attention to work processes in many areas of the company. It was necessary to develop a model of how data flowed from points of customer interaction, then to and between the company's various customer facing business units. In researching the best way to establish such a model I became aware of functional programming and began to investigate the languages and tools oriented towards this approach. We had started appraising the possibility of moving the project to a more functional technology stack when I was presented the opportunity to form part of the initial engineering team at Postedin.

At Postedin we inherited an Angular 1 (JS, frontend) and Laravel (PHP, backend) monolithic application and we were successful in rapidly re-writing the app to a React front-end, after trialing an Ember.js prototype, however the core Laravel API persisted until my departure from the company. We built other services around that API, also in Laravel, and as traffic grew migrated to an architecture more closely resembling micro-services. Our React frontend was built utilizing Redux, the tool most famous for adopting functional reactive programming, perhaps besides Elm. It was a challenging and highly rewarding project. Our team was based in Santiago de Chile, but operated remotely most of the time and organized horizontally (no hierarchical chain of command, every developer largely manages themselves in compliance with broad directives from the CTO).

I believe I have ample industry experience and could perform in exemplary fashion if given the POSITION position.

Warm Regards,  
Shayden
