## Resume

An accomplished developer and project lead, with experience working in self-directed and team settings. Capable of balancing project goals and resources to set reasonable expectations for software production, and follow through with on-time delivery.

I began my career as a web developer while employed as a Support Officer at the Melbourne Racing Club. Responsibility for the maintenance of their various web sites was not officially assigned to any individual and having a basic understanding of what was required, I nominated myself. This entailed working with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages, specifically PHP and Python; as well as the standard front-end languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to enhance and steward a dozen different web sites.

While working at the Melbourne Racing Club, I began to study the important concepts behind my new responsibility in my own time. Details of the HTTP specification, the consequences of an MVC application model, configuration of web servers, and relational databases to name a few.

At the end of 2012, a collegue and I found out that we had been accepted into Start-Up Chile, a startup accelerator backed by the Chilean Government. We had applied with an online vending platform for pharmacies called Medesen, the prototype of which I developed using PHP and Wordpress. During the program's 6-month duration, I rewrote our application in Python with the Django framework, hired contractors to assist in the development of our application and managed the project's spending and bookkeeping. Shortly after completion of the Start-Up Chile program I decided to leave the project, due to differences in opinion over its future between myself and the other founding member.

I took on the role of project lead for an internal Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application at Cocha Tourism in January of 2014. It was my responsibility to translate my department manager's needs into achievable project milestones. I inherited a PHP/Symfony and JS/jQuery stack, the frontend of which I restructured from a patchwork collection of jQuery events, hooks and callbacks to documented and independent modules. Integrating the CRM with the various internal systems at Cocha was a great opportunity to develop a diverse understanding of how data flowed through the many teams within the company. During my last couple of months at Cocha is when I first started to develop an interest in functional programming.

I started with Postedin in August 2014. They hired me for a diverse array of project needs, inluding: migrating a network of over a dozen Wordpress publications to Pelican, a static site generator written in Python; aiding in the re-write of their legacy code base to a new PHP/Laravel and JS/Ember stack; and configuring a Docker-based server architecture for a network of Discourse forums.

Clojure has been my language of choice since the beginnings of 2016. I have written a library in it, Turmeric, and a handful of personal projects. I understand category theory, lambda calculas and combinatory logic as they apply to programming, through the Curry-Howard(-Lambek) isomorphism and otherwise, as well as theoretically to an intermediate degree.

I have been living in Chile for the last 4 years and speak Spanish fluently.
